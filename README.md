# Image Recognition in AWS ðŸš€

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy an image recognition system using Amazon Web Services (AWS). It leverages **AWS Rekognition** for identifying objects, scenes, and faces in images. The system is integrated with other AWS services like **Amazon S3** for image storage and **AWS Lambda** for serverless processing. The system also utilizes **IAM** roles and policies to ensure secure access.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload images to an **Amazon S3** bucket.
- **Image Analysis**: Automatically trigger an **AWS Lambda** function upon image upload to analyze the image using **AWS Rekognition**.
- **Rekognition Analysis**: The system detects labels, objects, and faces in the uploaded images.
- **Secure and Scalable**: The solution uses **IAM** roles to provide secure and least-privilege access for services.
- **API Gateway Integration**: Optionally, expose APIs using **Amazon API Gateway** for user interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Amazon S3**: For storing the images.
- **AWS Lambda**: To run serverless functions for image processing.
- **Amazon Rekognition**: For performing image analysis, such as object recognition, facial detection, and scene recognition.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: For managing secure access and permissions between services.
- **Amazon API Gateway** (optional): For exposing APIs and enabling interaction with the system.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: 
   - Users upload images to an **Amazon S3** bucket either via a web interface, a CLI tool, or an API (via **API Gateway**).
  
2. **Trigger Lambda**:
   - The upload event triggers an **AWS Lambda** function automatically, which processes the image using **AWS Rekognition**.

3. **Rekognition Analysis**:
   - The Lambda function uses **Amazon Rekognition** to detect objects, faces, and scenes within the uploaded image.
  
4. **Return Analysis Results**:
   - The result from Rekognition (i.e., labels, detected faces, etc.) can be logged in **CloudWatch**, returned via API Gateway, or saved in a database.

5. **IAM Permissions**:
   - **IAM roles and policies** are used to securely manage access between S3, Rekognition, and Lambda services.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project, you need an AWS account and AWS CLI set up on your local machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-recognition-aws.git
   cd image-recognition-aws
   ```

2. **Configure AWS CLI**:  
   Set up your AWS CLI credentials by running:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   Provide your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, and region when prompted.

3. **Set up an S3 Bucket**:  
   Create an **Amazon S3** bucket via the AWS Console or AWS CLI to store images.

4. **Set up Lambda Function**:
   - Create an **AWS Lambda** function with the following IAM permissions:
     - `rekognition:DetectLabels`
     - `rekognition:DetectFaces`
     - `s3:GetObject`
     - `cloudwatch:PutLogEvents`
   - Deploy the Lambda function using the provided code.

5. **Configure S3 Bucket Trigger**:
   - Configure the S3 bucket to trigger the Lambda function every time an image is uploaded.

6. **Optional: Set Up API Gateway**:
   - You can set up **Amazon API Gateway** to expose a REST API to upload images and trigger the analysis function.

7. **Testing**:
   - Upload images to the S3 bucket, and monitor the Lambda logs in **CloudWatch** for the results from **Amazon Rekognition**.
